# SortingEfficiency
Java program made for Gr12 high school programming course ICS4U using NetBeans - compares the performance and efficiency of selection, bubble, insertion, and quick sort algorithms in both ascending and descending order for up to 5000 integers ranging from (-10000, 10000)

    Write a program that will display a list of random numbers
        • The random numbers should be in the range from -10 000 to 10 000 (inclusive)
        • The random numbers should be displayed in two text areas:
            a) numbers unsorted✓
            b) numbers sorted✓
        • A user should have the choice of:
            a) the number of random numbers to display
                --> 10✓, 100✓, 1000✓, or 5000✓
            b) the order the numbers will be sorted in
                --> ascending✓
                --> descending✓
            c) which algorithm they would like to see the numbers sorted by:
                [The program will sort the original unsorted numbers using four sorting methods studied in this unit:]
                    --> selection sort✓✓, bubble sort✓✓, insertion sort✓✓, and QUICKSORT✓✓
        • The program will display the:
            a) number of times a loop was executed✗
            b) actual time (in milliseconds) that it took to complete each sort✗
        • The program should perform the 4 sorts on the same set of data, so that the results are directly comparable
            [This means you will need 4 identical arrays to perform the sorting on]✓
            [There is a static copy method available in the Arrays class]✓
        • A new set of random numbers should be generated and displayed each time the user selects the 'Sort Numbers' button✓
